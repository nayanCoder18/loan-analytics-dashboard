### 💡 Advanced DAX Implementation

#### Core Measure Examples
#### Default Rate Calculation with Context Filtering:

```
dax
Default Rate by Employment Type = 
VAR TotalRecords = COUNTROWS(ALL('Loan_default'))
VAR DefaultCases = COUNTROWS(FILTER('Loan_default', 'Loan_default'[Default] = TRUE()))
RETURN
CALCULATE(
    DIVIDE(DefaultCases, TotalRecords),
    ALLEXCEPT('Loan_default', 'Loan_default'[EmploymentType])
) * 100
```
#### Year-over-Year Growth with Error Handling:
```
dax
YOY Loan Amount Change = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(SUM('Loan_default'[LoanAmount]), 'Loan_default'[Year] = YEAR(MAX('Loan_default'[Loan_Date_DD_MM_YYYY]))) - 
    CALCULATE(SUM('Loan_default'[LoanAmount]), 'Loan_default'[Year] = YEAR(MAX('Loan_default'[Loan_Date_DD_MM_YYYY])) - 1),
    CALCULATE(SUM('Loan_default'[LoanAmount]), 'Loan_default'[Year] = YEAR(MAX('Loan_default'[Loan_Date_DD_MM_YYYY])) - 1),
    0
) * 100
```
